## Individual Project#1: Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions of Python
### ðŸ“ºYouTube link for demo video:
https://youtu.be/xEIdOFCpTH8

### Purpose:
This project aims to automates data analysis using 'Pandas', including reading a dataset , obtaining its summary statistics and visualization, and realizing continuous integration using Github Actions. The dataset 'bmi.csv' is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rukenmissonnier/age-weight-height-bmi-analysis), which comprises 741 individual records).

### This repo contains:
* `.devcontainer`: including a 'Dockerfile' specifies how the container should be built

* `Github Actions`: contain configuration files (performs all four Makefile commands with badges) for setting up automated build, test and deployment pipelines for the project

* `Dockerfile`: specifies how the container should be built

* `Makefile`:  with tests, format, lint, and installation of dependencies
Run `make test` (test notebook and script and lib):

Run `make format` which formats code with python black:

* `requirement.txt`: to specify the dependencies required to run the project (run 'make install')

* `desc.ipynb`: a jupyternotebook with 1) cells that perform descriptive statistics using Pandas 2) tested by using nbval plugin for pytest

* `lib.py` and `test_lib.py`: 'lib.py' shares the common code between the script and notebook, and 'test_lib.py' to test library

* `script.py` and `test_scrip.py`: 'script.py' is a python script performing the descriptive statistic tasks using Pandas, and 'test_script' to test script

### Summary statistics:
The dataset contains 741 records with the following key statistics: Age: Average age is 31.6 years, ranging from 15 to 61 years. Height: Average height is 1.709 meters, ranging from 1.46 to 2.07 meters. Weight: Average weight is 78.4 kilograms, ranging from 25.9 to 270 kilograms. BMI: Average BMI is 26.4, ranging from 12.15 to 66.30. These statistics summarize the dataset's age, height, weight, and BMI attributes.

### Data visualizations:
For this project, I created a histogram for age distribution.

Also a scatterplot of Age vs Bmi
